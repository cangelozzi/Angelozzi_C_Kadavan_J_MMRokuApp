### Roku ‘Flashback’ microsite

The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to
access three separate flashback features; movies, television (tv) and music. Each of these three
sections are comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990
respectively.
One of Flashback's main usability features is the demarcation of the user profile. Users will be
divided into two distinct categories; administrators (labeled; Parents) and Kids. Parents will have
the ability to access all of Flashbacks' content and admin controls while 'Kids' will be limited to
content pushed down from Flashbacks “kid-friendly content" protocol queries. Admin users will
have the ability to customize settings being pushed down from Flashbacks CMS to provide a
unique viewing experience for their children.
